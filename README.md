# 👋 Welcome! I’m Alex,

## About
I'm a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence major passionate about applying technology to solve real-world problems.  Beyond building efficient algorithms and AI-driven applications, I'm deeply interested in addressing the challanges of AI bias and ensuring that intelligent systems are fair, transparent, and trustworthy. As a member of OWASP AI Exchange, I will continue to contribute to advancing best practices and supporting the broader public community in understanding and mitigating AI related risks.  On this Github, I showcase projects where I translate theory into practice.  My current areas of focus are machine learning models, optimization algorithms, and explorations in AI ethics and responsible development.  My goeas is to keep building impactful solutions while contributing to a more secure, equitable, and trustworth AI ecosystem.

- Focus Areas: Software engineering, machine learning, AI research, and scalable systems
- Academic Background: Computer Science & AI major with hands-on experience in projects and research
- What Drives Me: Using technology not just to innovate, but to empower people and communities
- Vision: To design intelligent solutions that bridge creativity, ethics, and cutting-edge engineering

✨ This GitHub is where I share my journey — from coding challenges and personal projects to research experiments and open-source contributions.
